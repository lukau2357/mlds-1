## Homework 1
Decision trees, Bootstrap aggregation and Random forests, feature importance with Breiman's algorithm.

## Homework 2
Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression implementation (L-BFGS used for optimizing log-likelihood). MLR coefficient interpretation.

## Hoemwork 3
Ridge regression (using the closed form solution with intercept) and Lasso regression (using the Powell method for optimization). Grid search for the best ridge regularization weight on a superconductor dataset.

## SVM Demo
Implementation of hard margin and soft margin SVM using CVXOPT library for quadratic programming. 2D demonstrations added for both algorithms.
